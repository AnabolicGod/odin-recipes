  <p>This Creamy chicken pasta recipe is the ultimate comfort meal. It is made with added chicken bites for some added protein, loaded with spinach for a nutrient boost, and infused with creamy Tuscan flavors..</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong> Pasta of choice:</strong> use whatever kind of pasta you already have. You may use gluten-free if needed or lentil pasta for a healthier option.</li>
    <li><strong> Chicken:</strong> go with chicken breast for a leaner and healthier option. You may also use boneless and skinless chicken thighs.</li>
    <li><strong> Oil:</strong> I used olive oil. You may use avocado oil or grapeseed oil.</li>
    <li><strong> Garlic cloves:</strong> I recommend you use fresh garlic cloves and not garlic powder. You may also use the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.</li>
    <li><strong> Italian seasoning:</strong> if you don’t have this handy, use 1/4 tsp of the following seasonings- basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme.</li>
    <li><strong> Salt and pepper to taste</strong></li>
    <li><strong> Sun-dried tomatoes:</strong> use the ones that are packed in oil and not the packets.</li>
    <li><strong> Almond milk:</strong> if you don’t have almond milk, use any milk of choice.</li>
    <li><strong> Flour:</strong> use any flour you have on hand, or use cornstarch.</li>
    <li><strong> Fresh baby spinach:</strong> I prefer that you use fresh spinach. If you want to use frozen, you can, but just thaw and drain first.</li>
    <li><strong> Parmesan cheese:</strong> grate your own. You may substitute this cheese with grated Romano Cheese.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes and continue to cook until cooked through about 5-7 minutes. Pour in the flour and milk mixture over the seared chicken. Allow the sauce to bubble for a few minutes to thicken up. It should take no more than 3-4 minutes. Add spinach.</li>

  <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> use pasta of choice. Gluten-free, whole wheat, lentil pasta, or chickpea pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> I used chicken breast, but you may use boneless thighs. Consider using shrimp instead of chicken if desired.</li>
    <li><strong>Spinach: </strong>I recommend using fresh spinach. Frozen spinach can be used, but thaw first and drain to remove excess water.</li>
    <li><strong></strong>You may use other veggies like kale.</li>
    <li>Use <strong>fresh garlic</strong> or replace it with 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.</li>
    <li><strong></strong>Cook the pasta al dente since it will cook again with everything else to prevent having soft and soggy pasta.</li>
    <li>Store leftover chicken pasta in a container and store it in the fridge for up to<strong> 3 days.</strong></li>
  </ul>
