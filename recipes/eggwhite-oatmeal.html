  <h2>How to make:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix egg whites, protein powder and cocoa powder together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Add and mix in oatmeal.</li>
    <li>Microwave for about 60 seconds, mix the bowl, microwave for another 60 seconds and mix it again. Microwave for another 30 seconds. This is just how I like it, you can try different approaches to this step.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the chocolate bits on top and pour in the yoghurt on top. The yoghurt should not be mixed in but just lay on top.</li>
  </ol>
